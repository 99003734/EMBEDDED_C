## HIGH LEVEL TEST PLAN
|**SLNO**|**Test ID**|**Testing Function**|**Expected Input**|**Expected Output**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| 1 | HLR1 | Wiper Control Module | When moisture sensor senses the water, it sends signal to wiper shield to turn on | Wiper shield will work properly |
| 2 | HLR2 | Interior Light Control Module | Any kind of motion detected in the PIR Motion Sensor (for example when the door is open) | The interior lighting will work properly |
| 3 | HLR3 | Adaptive light Control Module | LDR sensor sense the presence and absence of light is necessary | Turn on/off street lights when needed |
| 4 | HLR4 | Car Reverse Gear Buzzer | Car Reverse Radar Sensor detect the objects during reversing the vehicle and sends signal to buzzer | Buzzer starts beeping when the person in vehicle  uses reverse gear |
